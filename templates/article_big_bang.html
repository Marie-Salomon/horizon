        <h2>The Primal Singularity</h2>
        <p>
            According to the Big Bang theory: the universe began <strong>smaller than a pinhead</strong>, yet with unimaginable density, pressure, and heat. It's difficult to grasp the incredible energy that reigned then—energy we couldn't even reproduce in our laboratories today.
        </p>
        
        

        <div style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic;">
            <p>
                Then, in barely a fraction of a second, the Universe began to expand dramatically. It was at this moment that the first elementary particles, much smaller than the atom, appeared: <strong>electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons...</strong> a chaotic but creative dance that would eventually form everything we see today.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        <p>
            The expansion continued, and with it, the cosmic temperature began to plummet. About <strong>380,000 years after the Big Bang</strong>, the heat dropped below 3,000°C (a stark contrast to the -271°C we measure today). 
        </p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 0;">✨ The First Light</h3>
            <p>
                As the universe cooled, electrons slowed down enough to be captured by atomic nuclei, forming the very first atoms of <strong>hydrogen and helium</strong>. This was the birth of matter as we know it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until then, <strong>photons</strong> (the particles of light) were trapped in a dense, opaque "cosmic soup." Suddenly, they were free to travel through space: <strong>the Universe lit up in a magnificent flash.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.8;">
            However, this brilliance was short-lived. Since stars and galaxies had not yet formed, the Universe eventually faded into what scientists call the "Dark Ages," waiting millions of years for the first stars to ignite.

        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">The Great Shift: From Static to Dynamic</h2>
        
        <p>
            In the early 20th century, the scientific world was convinced the Universe was <strong>static and eternal</strong>. Even <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> initially shared this belief, later calling it his "greatest blunder."

                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">
                    Russian mathematician <strong>Alexander Friedmann</strong> first suggested an expanding universe. Shortly after, Belgian priest and scientist <strong>Georges Lemaître</strong> provided the mathematical proof, envisioning a universe that "swells" over time.

                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;">
                    Astronomer <strong>Edwin Hubble</strong> observed that distant galaxies were fleeing from us. This wasn't just movement; it was the <strong>dilation of space-time</strong> itself.

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
            Lemaître proposed the "Primeval Atom" theory—the precursor to the Big Bang. While it faced years of skepticism, his logic that the entire cosmos originated from a <strong>single point</strong> eventually became the foundation of modern cosmology.

        <h2 style="color: var(--accent);">The Echo of Creation: Cosmic Microwave Background</h2>
        
        <p>
            The most definitive proof of our origins is the <strong>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</strong>. This is the "first light" of the Universe—the monumental flash that occurred 380,000 years after the Big Bang.

                <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0;">
                    Theorized in the late 1940s, this "fossil radiation" was actually detected by accident in 1965. Two American physicists, while testing a ultra-sensitive radio antenna, picked up a mysterious background noise they couldn't explain. This "hiss" turned out to be the afterglow of the Big Bang, earning them the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics</strong>.

        </div>

        <p>
            Today, this light still exists as a uniform hum of radio waves present everywhere in the cosmos. Between 2009 and 2013, the <strong>European Planck satellite</strong> successfully "photographed" this radiation with unprecedented precision, providing us with the oldest map of our Universe.

                <p>In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from us. The further they are, the faster they go. This proved the universe is expanding.</p>

                <p>Discovered by accident in 1964, this faint "hiss" of radio waves is the afterglow of the Big Bang itself, cooled over billions of years.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>Understanding the Big Bang allows us to calculate the age of the universe (13.8 billion years) and predict its ultimate fate. Most of our research today comes from telescopes like <strong>Planck</strong> and the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope</strong>.</p>
